"No Rain Today"<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
My heart was full of empty space<br>
Before you came along.<br>
But visions of your smiling face<br>
Have turned my daydreams on<br>
<br>
I didn’t used to dream like this<br>
No stories to unfold<br>
You’ve changed my life with just a kiss<br>
My heart’s taken control<br><br>
<br>
[chorus]<br>
Take me by the hands<br>
Time falls away<br>
Long as I think of you<br>
There’ll be no rain today<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Vivid colors fill my eyes<br>
It all now seems so clear,<br>
I wasn’t really living life<br>
With no one to be near.<br>
<br>
And now that I’m so full of song<br>
I’ve got to laugh in time, ha-ha-haah!<br>
You’ve shown me I was very wrong<br>
to live a lonely life.<br>
<br>
[chorus]<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Every Day now feels like new<br>
Full of brand new schemes<br>
Together plotting sweet escapes<br>
And whispering our dreams<br>
<br>
I want to tell the whole wide world<br>
That life is not so bad<br>
And though I know he’d disapprove<br>
I want to tell my dad<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
<br>
"Can’t Go Back"<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Thanksgiving is on my mind<br>
As the afternoon unwinds<br>
There’s ash in the air, but the weather is fair<br>
I’m eating humble pie<br>
I’m eating humble pie.<br>
<br>
In the middle of November,<br>
the stars all shine like embers<br>
Something I said, emotions misread<br>
And I must feel oh so clever<br>
I must feel oh so clever.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
there’s a whole wide world goin on<br>
You could wake up one day, and everything’s gone<br>
Show some kindness to those who lack<br>
When November burns, and you can’t go back<br>
<br>
[Verse]<br>
Playing that old time rag<br>
In a smoldering dream of the past<br>
How could I know where the dry winds blow<br>
And that nothing is made to last,<br>
That nothing is made to last?<br>
<br>
We dug up the metal frame<br>
Where the piano used to play.<br>
It was two years ago and I still don’t know<br>
If we’ll ever be the same,<br>
If we’ll ever be the same.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Run Away With Me [used]<br>
<br>
The scientists all say<br>
That the temperature's running away<br>
So run away with me,  Run away with me, my love<br>
<br>
Existence was our crime<br>
Now we've got to do our time<br>
So run away with me,  Run away with me, my love<br>
<br>
When the doomsday clock hits 12,<br>
I don't wanna love nobody else<br>
So run away with me, run away with me my love<br>
<br>
There's mad prophets on the streets today<br>
And their signs all seem to say<br>
Run away with me, run away with me my love<br>
<br>
I saw you at your window, and I won't forget the words that you said to me<br>
You and I will find a way together baby this is our Destiny<br>
<br>
The world is out of control<br>
But baby we've still got soul<br>
So run away with me,  Run away with me, my love<br>
<br>
Instrumental verse<br>
<br>
The world is out of control<br>
But baby we've still got soul<br>
So run away with me,  Run away with me, my love<br>
So run away with me,  Run away with me, my love<br>
So run away with me,  Run away with me, my love<br>
<br>
<br>
Somebody<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Sometimes I'm higher than a satellite<br>
Feeling like an outlaw gunning for a fight<br>
My foolish pride is bound to get me hurt<br>
Somebody bring me back to Earth!<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Sometimes I'm walkin' on a tightrope wire<br>
I get so dizzy when my heart's on fire<br>
I wear my love just like a king in his crown<br>
Somebody help me get back down<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Now when I get low and the breezes blow<br>
I'm a dried-up tumbleweed<br>
If I ain’t in the clouds or deep underground<br>
I'm lost in the in-between<br>
<br>
[Verse 3}<br>
Sometimes I'm looking thru my telescope<br>
Stuck on an Island far away from hope<br>
Find me some driftwood or a big balloon<br>
Somebody better get here soon!<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
<br>
You’ll Pay a Price<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I know you want to be somebody's angel<br>
But everyone's so hot and cold<br>
Do you think that you're a cosmic surgeon<br>
I think your act is getting old<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I know that you don't like his friends<br>
You say that they're too much like yours<br>
But don't let it keep you from sleeping<br>
You'll pay a price that your mind cant afford<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I see you're back again at the racetrack<br>
I thought that it was bad for your health<br>
You always bet your life on the losers<br>
It's time to take a look at yourself<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Your heart string's more like a livewire<br>
Don't you feel so high sometimes?<br>
But the sun gets hot in the summer, baby<br>
So be careful how high you fly <br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
<br>
Me and You<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Reunited childhood friends<br>
But I feel something new<br>
Scared to let you know and wondrin'<br>
If you feel it too.<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Now we both have chemistry<br>
The first class after lunch<br>
A thousand freckles on your face<br>
You always said you loved the sun<br>
<br>
[Prechorus]<br>
Now I'm sitting next to you<br>
And you joke about your love<br>
But In your eyes I see some clues<br>
That a river's bound to flood<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I could be your sunshine<br>
When Autumn skies are gray<br>
I'll keep you from the darkness<br>
and chase the clouds away<br>
<br>
Sunny days all filled with song<br>
A full moon shining all night long<br>
We could be each other's dream come true...<br>
Me and You.<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I dreamed about the summertime<br>
The two of us alone<br>
I've kept my heart locked in my chest<br>
But maybe it still shows<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Those songs of love we danced to<br>
on the last day of 5th grade<br>
Now I understand them<br>
And I sing them when it rains <br>
<br>
[Prechorus]<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
Drivin in the rain<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Fireworks on a summer night <br>
We were lying on the grass<br>
I watched the moment split the sky<br>
and then I felt it pass<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
My pen and paper tell the things<br>
that my mouth never does<br>
There's no room in our talking<br>
for words like we and us<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Curtains on my window<br>
they don't keep out your sunshine<br>
My head is spinning round it feels like<br>
West Virginia moonshine<br>
I think I need a doctor <br>
But I’m scared of what she'd say<br>
I'm listening to your favorite song<br>
While driving thru the rain<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Mama says that I'm still young<br>
And many doors are open<br>
But lately when I think of you<br>
I see that one is closin<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
I know your dreams are bigger<br>
than what this town can give<br>
And who am I to kill your dreams,<br>
Who am I to live?<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
[Coda Verse]<br>
Fireworks on a summer night <br>
We were lying on the grass<br>
<br>
Ace<br>
<br>
[Soft part]<br>
I set my picture to black and I'm not taking your texts<br>
I hope they're all too afraid to ask<br>
That last message was meant for the voice in my head<br>
But I sent it to you, <br>
and now i'm fading fast<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
3 years disappeared on a winters day<br>
I'm feeling like i don't deserve to know your name<br>
And you deserve someone I don't think I could be<br>
Screaming at the ceiling,<br>
"I guess the joke's on me"<br>
<br>
[Chorus 1]<br>
Why am I the one who never figured my shit out<br>
You’re the only one on earth who could have saved me from this town<br>
Why am I the one who’s got to take this to my grave <br>
But you don't need to worry cuz we're better off this way<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
I blame the meds, blame my youth I blame this one bad dream<br>
They rushed you out but I was stranded in a movie screen<br>
I don't know if I meant to make you feel that way<br>
I broke my knuckles <br>
over something I can't face<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
I’m a disgrace, I’m too far gone, i did it to myself<br>
A Summertime confession or  cry for help<br>
Its in the past like the last thing that youv see<br>
before you wake up in a room with an EKG<br>
<br>
[Chorus 2]v
Why am I the one who never figured my shit out<br>
You’re the only one on earth who could have saved me from this town<br>
Why am I the one who's got to take this to my grave <br>
But I should not complain I think you’re better off this way<br>
<br>
[B Svection]<br>
I guess it’s okay.  Did I guess wrong?<br>
I put my sickness in a song<br>
So I can laugh about my feelings<br>
When my feelings are all gone<br>
<br>
But I don't think that I can help<br>
that I can't love nobody else<br>
Our lives go on I know we've changed<br>
But I still think of you the same <br>
Sometiiiimes.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Why am I the one who never figured my shit out<br>
You’re the only one on earth who could have saved me from this town<br>
Why am I the one who's got to take this to my grave <br>
But I should not complain I’m  probly better off this way<br>
<br>
[Soft]<br>
I'm driving you back to your dorm it’s close to dawn<br>
You said his love for you was gone<br>
Waterworks on the dormitory lawn<br>
and you say "I'm surprised, that you never moved on"<br>
<br>
Tell Me that you Want I Should  Stay<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
when I first loved you I was<br>
Feeling good.<br>
Had peace of mind that we were<br>
Understood.<br>
But now there’s talk that you have<br>
Been untrue<br>
Now every word feels like a-<br>
Nother clue<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
But I don’t want to lose you babe<br>
And I would do whatever it takes<br>
To keep you by my side<br>
I would trade my foolish pride<br>
If you tell my that you want I should stay<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
When I first needed help you were<br>
Always there<br>
Sometimes I got tired but you<br>
Never cared<br>
Now you turn away and your old<br>
Smile is gone<br>
My worry’s got me staying up un-<br>
Til the dawn<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
But if you have to gov<br>
I just want you to know<br>
You better give me back that that guitar<br>
I’d say that it’s a shame<br>
If you sing out her name<br>
Breaking strings that I gave from my heart<br>
<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
<br>
"Wings"<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
I’m coughing out my sorrows<br>
In the cold October moonlight<br>
All yellow from the ashes<br>
Of a burned down lover’s fire fight<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
There’s memories in the junkyard<br>
Dead ink on torn up in paper<br>
A comb you left for me to see<br>
and some photographs of strangers<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
The stars all dance like busted angels<br>
Could be my weary eyes<br>
My soul’s strung out on the telephone line<br>
I got no wings to fly<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Second-guessing smiles<br>
And tears that fell between us<br>
On warm and summer midnights<br>
Stranded there on Venus<br>
<br>
[Verse 4]<br>
Packing up what’s left of me<br>
I got no destination<br>
Except to save my helpless heart<br>
from total devastation.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
<br>
"Mulhulland Highway"<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Board games and midnight calls<br>
Super Smash and alcohol<br>
Nobody slept til a quarter to 5<br>
Strange confessions on a summer night<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
Heavy rains kept the waters flowin<br>
Down the winding two-lane roads and<br>
Undercurrents and jealous hearts<br>
Forks in the river under distant stars<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
Have you ever worried ‘bout talkin’ in your sleep”<br>
Side conversations and the secrets and they keep?<br>
Mulholland Highway’s such a long long drive<br>
Mulholland Highway such a sad goodbye<br>
<br>
[Verse 3]<br>
Feelin cold under Coldwater skies<br>
Guess I still love her and I’ve paid the price<br>
Stopped to look down from the inbetween<br>
A new perspective on the city scene.<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
<br>
"Slipping"<br>
<br>
[Chorus]<br>
I think I’m slippin’<br>
Slippin again<br>
Back down the mountain<br>
Back to where I began<br>
<br>
Slippin’ oh oh<br>
Slippin’ today<br>
<br>
[Verse 1]<br>
Tried so hard not to be such a clown<br>
But I’m still the biggest fool in this town<br>
Feels like I’m drivin up the steepest hill<br>
It starts to rain and I’m in for a spill<br>
<br>
[Verse 2]<br>
That’s what i get for feelin’ good<br>
I get carried away like some soggy driftwood<br>
Leavin’ the party with a hundred regrets<br>
But I don’t think the worst is over yet, because <br>
<br>
[chorus]<br>
<br>
[verse 3]<br>
Laughing like a loser at my own dumb jokes<br>
Feeling flat like a wheel without spokes<br>
My fragile ego sinks down through the floor<br>
Guess I’ll see myself right out the door<br>
<br>
[chorus]<br>
<br>
[Bridge]<br>
I used to laugh when somebody else cried<br>
I want to leave that part of me behind<br>
That highschool joker who never tried<br>
to rise above the mischief in his mind <br>
but<br>
[Chorus<br>
Seattle<br>
<br>
I ride around with a dried up rose<br>
Skies are dark, I got no home<br>
Grey and heavy like my soul<br>
the clouds are hanging low<br>
<br>
Rivers rushing round my mind<br>
Flowing into sees of wine<br>
I think about you all the time<br>
You struck my very soul<br>
<br>
The world that lives  inside this pen<br>
is full of wars I can’t defend<br>
I love you and your new boyfriend<br>
He looks a lot like me<br>
<br>
Rehearse the words I need to say<br>
Life sentences I bleed in vain<br>
Two strangers in a picture frame<br>
My heart won’t set them free<br>
<br>
All that has been<br>
All that has been<br>
All that has been<br>
Can never be<br>
<br>
<br>
I can see your distant star<br>
I tell myself it’s not that far<br>
But I’m confined to boulevards<br>
and dreams of summer lost<br>
<br>
Tomorrow’s blowing through the trees<br>
In sad and empty canopies<br>
The poison roots that run too deep<br>
And one-way bridges crossed<br>
<br>
<br>
"Always Late"<br>
<br>
The sun went down, <br>
I fooled around<br>
(AMaj7)My head is full of purple clouds<br>
And plus I don’t do well with crowds<br>
(AMaj7)I guess I’m always late<br>
<br>
She passed me by<br>
Before my eyes<br>
I took too long to realize<br>
That I could have been her special guy<br>
I guess I’m always late<br>
<br>
There’s lover’s hearts a-thu(B)mpin<br>
And night time bedrooms bu(B)mpin<br>
I think I’ll be one hu(G#m7)ndred<br>
(AMaj7)Before I get it (B)right<br>
<br>
I missed the signs<br>
I must be blind<br>
(AMaj7)Delinquent on these traffic fines<br>
I just can't leave the past behind<br>
(AMaj7)I guess I’m always late<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
Fermi Paradox<br>
<br>
While I was still in Highschool<br>
We broke down in Laurel Canyon<br>
I entered some new paradigm<br>
I don’t really know how it happened<br>
And I suddenly acquired<br>
the capacity for self destruction<br>
And a penchant for denial<br>
Of the finger on the button<br>
<br>
Now I go to all these parties<br>
Because it helps improve my acting<br>
I locked my heart in concrete<br>
to prevent it from reacting<br>
And I’ve got no big ideas<br>
I’m just a product of the factory<br>
And even if I make a difference<br>
Well, it’s probably subtracting<br>
<br>
I once prayed for some guidance<br>
But all the stars were laughing<br>
And now all I want is some quiet<br>
And the stars are all collapsing<br>
And I want to leave you a message<br>
So beautiful and tragic<br>
But I deleted all your contact info so I…<br>
Guess I’ll... just go back<br>
to sleep<br>
<br>
